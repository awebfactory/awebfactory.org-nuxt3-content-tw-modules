## Process workflows and artifacts internalized and used throughout my career

### 2004 RUP

- 2004 [RUP](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rup/) -> [archive wayback](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402113344/http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rup/)
  - [Live RUP site today](https://sceweb.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/) thanks to University of Houston Clear Lake, College of Science and Engineering
    - Include more modern [SWEN 5431 V and V reading Test documentation](https://sceweb.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/process/workflow/test/int_test.htm)

### 2006 Agile Manifesto (signed)

- 2006 Signed the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
  - [Signatures Received: 30 Jul to 12 Aug 2006](http://agilemanifesto.org/display/000000067.html)
    > Victor Kane: (AWebFactory) Building software must be built around real human needs, and neither the product nor the process shoved down people's throats. The need for software and the need to produce that software must be framed in a process (the process mirrored in the product - Hudson), is optimized by open, flowing structures reflecting those very real needs and their most excellent solutions. Obstacles imposed by greed and the need to defend privilege must be removed. Working people who produce and use software must together manage that process themselves, worldwide.

### 2007 Iconix

- [2007 ICONIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICONIX)
  1. [Rosenberg, D. & Stephens, M. (2007). Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML: Theory and Practice. Apress. (ISBN 1590597745)](https://www.amazon.com/Use-Case-Driven-Object-Modeling/dp/1430243058)
  2. [Rosenberg, D., Stephens, M. & Collins-Cope, M. (2005). Agile Development with ICONIX Process. Apress. (ISBN 1590594649)](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-ICONIX-Process-Pragmatism/dp/1430212276/ref=sr_1_10?qid=1668092661&refinements=p_27%3ADon+Rosenberg&s=books&sr=1-10&text=Don+Rosenberg&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc)
- The Iconix process was **fundamental** in my development as it bridged the **_abyss_** existing in my mind at the moment between analysis (use case, use case diagrams) and design (class diagrams, class model) in object-oriented design

### 2009 Leveraging Drupal

- [2009-02 Leveraging Drupal. Getting Your Site Done Right](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Leveraging+Drupal%3A+Getting+Your+Site+Done+Right-p-9780470410875)
- My book, published in 2009, dealt extensively with an agile-based process to be used in the development of web applications.

### 2011 Project Flow & Tracker

- [PFT Project Flow & Tracker](https://www.drupal.org/project/pft)

### 2013 Lean/UX

- Discussions with colleagues, as well as critique of Agile and PFT as being team-insufficient leads me to Lean UX
- Formative books and resources for me:
  - Jeff Gothelf, [Lean UX Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/lean-ux/9781449366834/)
  - Laura Klein, [UX for Lean Startups](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ux-for-lean/9781449335007/)
- My write up (an important synthesis for me) at that time: [Lean Project docs](https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean/wiki) applicable not only to Drupal sites, but mainly web application projects in general, as I was already working with Nodejs/Express.

#### 2014 DrupalPicchu Drupal Lean Process and Code as Single Source of Truth

- (_Spanish_) [2014-01-20 Slides del Taller Drupal Lean Process y Todo en Código con Herramientas](https://www.slideshare.net/victorkane/taller-drupal-lean-process)

#### 2015 DrupalCon Latin America 2015

- **Extremely important milestone in enhancing my own synthesis of Lean/UX and Agile for Web Application development**

- [2015-02-12 Setting up a Reusable and DurableDrupal Lean Process Factory – Presentation 2/11/2015 at DrupalCon Latin America 2015](https://awebfactory.com/node/532/)

  - [GitHub issues capture the process](https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue)
  - [GitHub Wiki: Guides, Templates, etc.](https://github.com/victorkane/lit-drupal-lean/wiki)

### 2021 Headless WordPress Project and its process

- [2021-02-19 GitHub Project. The re-making of AWebFactory.com. Headless WordPress Content Migration Rescue](https://github.com/orgs/awebfactory/projects/1)

### 2022 Atomic Design Systems, Code as single source of truth with figma and framer

- [Brad Frost's Blog Post on Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
- 2022 Interest in figma and design systems (framer motion + next via ES module links (import atomic, molecular links)): the idea is to make everything "code as single source of truth" and have designers work in code (as Jason was suggesting with: drawing -> html (UI library like bootstrap))
- Let's galvanize

  - the process workflow
  - the artifacts

- **Main focus is the avoidance of team member silos and the road to interdisciplinary development with code as a single source of truth (as in design systems with Figma + UI Components)**

## Conclusion

- Final list of process workflow, artifact and tools scenarios:

  - Agile
  - Lean/UX
  - Design Systems
  - DevOps and CI/CD

- > `[unfinished, to be completed and continued]`
